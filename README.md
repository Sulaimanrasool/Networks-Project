==========================================


This project aims to study degree distributions produced by growing networks. In specific, we study the Barabasi and Albert model with modifications. This repository contains only the model file and the report, all other files to answer specific questions about the project are not included. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The .zip file initially contains the following items:

1) 'BA_model.py' - python file:
  This contains the code for the Barabasi Albert model, which was then used to research the properties of self-organised criticality. 
 
2) '1519545-NetworksReport.pdf' - PDF file
   This contains the project report, highlighting the research work.

******* How to run the data **********

Each python file is self-contained. Running each file will produce the results shown in the report.
